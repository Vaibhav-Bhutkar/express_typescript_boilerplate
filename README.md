# express_typescript_boilerplate
This is an express js base templte with type-script using node js as framework.
If any developer wantes to use just download this repository and run command in terminal as - npm install.
It will install necessary npm packages such as - typescript, node, nodemon, express js and axios. As a developer to if need to implement anything using express js 
and type script then we need to create project and install above necessary packages. Instead of doing all thse, developer/user can directly use this boiler plate and 
start using if for your purpose.
